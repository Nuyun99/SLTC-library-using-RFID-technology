HOW TO RUN
=
If you are in the windows,
>It is very simple. In the "Setup & exe"  folder there is the "LibraryAutomationSystem.exe" and run it on your Windows machine

If you are in other OS,
>you have to get the "Library_System.jar" file and you hae to convert in to runnable file or otherwise you can run with your java ide with these source files.

Thank You
